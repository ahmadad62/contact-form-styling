## Styling Forms

This is a piece of HTML and CSS code that represents a web page. The HTML code defines the structure of the page and the CSS code provides styling to the HTML elements.

The page has a header section with a logo and a main section with two boxes. The first box has a heading and a paragraph text, and the second box has a heading, a paragraph text, and a form to make a reservation.

The CSS code provides styling to the various HTML elements used on the page. It sets the background image, font styles, and colors, and also positions the elements on the page.
